  NOTE:  Users may find that the median is the best representation of
			the center of the distribution

	Be sure to make the number of cells no more than 25% of the "length"

 	 price = input series
 	 length = number of past items to be included in the distribution
 	 ncells = the number of cells in the frequency distribution (default and maximum = 20) }

	inputs: length(50), ncells(10);
