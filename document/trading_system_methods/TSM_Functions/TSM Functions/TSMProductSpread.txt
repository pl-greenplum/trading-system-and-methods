{ TSMProductSpread : Energy or soybean product spread (crack and crush)
   Copyright 1999, P.J.Kaufman. All rights reserved.

   This program calculates the estimated gross profit of a refiner
	who buys crude oil and sells products (gasoline and heating oil).

   Inputs:	data1 is the price of crude oil or soybeans
			data2 is the price of product 1 (gasoline or soybean oil)
			data3 is the price of product 2 (heating oil or soybean meal)
			units1 are the number of contracts of crude (CL=3)
			units2 are the number of contracts of product1 (HU=2)
			units3 are the number of contracts of product2 (HO=1)

   NOTE: For a correct crack spread, use the one month deferred from crude oil
			 for the products. The correct spread ratio is slightly more than 2 parts
			of gasoline to one part of fuel oil; there are additional residual products. }

	inputs:	units1(numeric), units2(numeric), units3(numeric);
	vars:    spread(0);

	spread =     units2*close of data2*bigpointvalue of data2
			 	+ units3*close of data3*bigpointvalue of data3
				  - units1*close of data1*bigpointvalue of data1;

	TSMProductSpread = spread;
