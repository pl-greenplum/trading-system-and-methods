{ TSMImpliedInterest : Implied Interest Rates
   Copyright 1999, P.J.Kaufman. All rights reserved.

   This program calculates the implied interest rate based
 	on the difference between two price series, e.g., spot
	and forward gold, or two forward contracts.

   Inputs:	price1 is the nearby price series
			price2 is the deferred price series
			ndiff is the number of months between the two }

	inputs: price1(numericseries), price2(numericseries), ndiff(numericsimple);

	TSMImpliedInterest = (price2 - price1) * (12 / ndiff);
